# The challenge:

We want to get a simple shopping cart. For this, we need to build a NodeJs application that allows us to
* Ask for available products.
* Add or delete products to and from the cart.
* Check at all times the available stock.
* **Extra:** It's good to know what the best products to buy are, or maybe the best sold products in the store.

## What you have to code

* A NodeJs application with all endpoints to solve our exercise.
* Postman collection file.
* Extra: We will be so happy if you can make the solution oriented to a microservices architecture.

## Skills we are going to assert:

**General coding skills:**

* How readable your code is
* How you structure your code

**Modeling skills:**

* Which model you create to solve the problem

**Problem solving skills:**

* How you solve logical problems
* How you use the tools the language provides
* How well you know the best practices of the language
* Which patterns you put in practice
* Which best practices you use
* Basic git skills, how you organize the changes.


**Skills we are NOT going to assert:**

* Page load performance optimization
* Extra features we did not ask for our application

## How to start with the exercise

To start with the exercise you need to run this command to build the Docker containers

    ./up.sh
If you want to load some example products you can use our seeders:

    ./seeders.sh
